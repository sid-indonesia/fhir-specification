# {{page-title}}
Defines the ID Core constraints and extensions on the Immunization resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve an individualâ€™s immunisation information.

## Usage
This profile is intended to cover the recording of current and historical administration of vaccines to individuals across all healthcare disciplines in all care settings and all regions. This profile does not support the administration of non-vaccine agents, even those that may have or claim to have immunological effects. While the terms "immunisation" and "vaccination" are not clinically identical, for the purposes of the FHIR profile, the terms are used synonymously.
