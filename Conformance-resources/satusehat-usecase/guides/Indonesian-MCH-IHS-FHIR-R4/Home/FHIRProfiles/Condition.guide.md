Defines the ID Core constraints and extensions on the Condition resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve problems and health concerns information.

## Usage
This profile allows recording of detailed information about a condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern. The condition could be a point in time diagnosis in the context of an encounter, it could be an item on the practitioner’s problem list, or it could be a concern that doesn’t exist on the practitioner’s problem list. Often, a condition is about a clinician's assessment and assertion of a particular aspect of an individual's state of health. It can be used to record information about a disease/illness identified from application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that a practitioner considers harmful, potentially harmful and may be investigated and managed (problem), or other health issue/situation that may require ongoing monitoring and/or management (health issue/concern).
