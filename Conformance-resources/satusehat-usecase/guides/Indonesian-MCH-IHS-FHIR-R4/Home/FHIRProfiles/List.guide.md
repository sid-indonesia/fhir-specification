Defines the ID Core constraints and extensions on the List resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve a list of information.


## Usage
This profile allows exchange of a flat, possibly ordered collection of records. The list profile can be used in many places, including allergies, medications, alerts, family history, medical history, etc. This list profile can be used to support individual-specific clinical lists as well as lists that manage workflows such as tracking patients, managing teaching cases, etc. The list profile supports lists that are homogeneous – consisting of only one type of resource (e.g. allergy lists) as well as heterogeneous – containing a variety of resources (e.g. a problem list including Conditions, AllergyIntolerances, recent Procedures, etc.).
