Defines the ID Core constraints and extensions on the Specimen resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve specimen information.

## Usage
The purpose of this resources is to provide detailed information about any material sample taken from a biological entity (living or dead) or taken from a phyisical object (or the environment).

Some specimens are biological and can contain one or more components including but not limited to cellular molecules, cells, tissues, organs, body fluids, embryos, and body excretory products.

The specimen resource covers substances used for diagnostic and environmental testing. The focus of the specimen resource is the process for gathering, maintaining and processing the specimen as well as where the specimen originated. This is distinct from the use of Substance which is only used when these other aspects are not relevant.
